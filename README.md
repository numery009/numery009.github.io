# Deploying Angular Project to a Github Page

We have to go inside the project directory and run the following command on the terminal-

ng build --prod

This command will create a new folder name- dist. Dist folder contains some file along with index.html.
Now create a GitHub repository with the following pattern- username.github.io. And upload all the files 
from the dist folder to the repository. 

Now open any browser hit the url accoring to the repository name- username.github.io.

In my case url is -numery009.github.io
